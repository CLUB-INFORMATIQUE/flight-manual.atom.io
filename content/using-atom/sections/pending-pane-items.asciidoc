=== Pending Pane Items

_"Pending Pane Items" were formerly referred to as "Preview Tabs"_

When you open a new file by single-clicking in the tree view, it will open in a new tab with an italic title. This indicates that the file is "pending". When a file is pending, it will be replaced by the next pending file that is opened. This allows you to click through a bunch of files to find something without having to go back and close them all.

You can confirm a pending file by doing any of the following:

* Double-clicking the tab of the file
* Double-clicking the file in the tree view
* Editing the contents of the file
* Saving the file

You can also open a file already confirmed by double-clicking it in the tree view instead of single-clicking it.
